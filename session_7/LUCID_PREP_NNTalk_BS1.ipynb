From robotics and self-driving cars to augmented reality devices and facial recognition software, models that make predictions from data are all around us. Many of these applications implement neural networks, which basically allows the computer to analyze data similar to the way the human brain analyzes data.\n",

This means that we can create a model, feed it tons and tons of data, and the model will learn features from the data that are important for accomplishing the task.\n",
